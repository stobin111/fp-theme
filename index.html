      <h1 id="overview">ASU Web Standards</h1>

      <p class="lead">ASU Web Standards are a foundation for building consistency throughout the user experience in the ASU Website Ecosystem. While this may not encompass every need your site has, it will act as a framework to guide you in the design process and will be expanded from here over time. These standardized components are the result of user research, user data, and collaborative Design Studio workshops.</p>

      <p>This first phase of Web Standards includes standards for RFI's, degree detail landing pages, partial information architecture for schools and a few other important items to standardize across the domain. You will find all of the required components that are needed for your site to become a part of the standardized ASU Website Ecosystem.</p>
